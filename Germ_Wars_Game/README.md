## Germ Wars 
In the same way armed forces take part in war games to ensure combat readiness, I expect countries will participate in  "germ games" following the outbreak of Covid-19 to test pandemic readiness. This game is a simplified version where the player is coordinating global efforts against an unpredictable, spreading virus. At each turn, the player makes decisions on behalf of the 7 continents, alotting finite productivity to various actions (research_vaccine, produce_mask, build_hospital, educate_population) each of which has a unique impact on that continents rate of spread. Continents can also set binary policies (close_border, shelter, full_lockdown) which impacts the continent's productivity output per turn, the rate of infection, and the population happiness.
